## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
install.packages(c("gsl","ggplot2","remotes","rmarkdown","UpSetR"))
# If you haven't install Bioconductor yet:
install.packages('BiocManager')
BiocManager::install()

BiocManager::install(c("GenomicRanges", "rtracklayer", "EnrichedHeatmap", "AnnotationHub", 
                       "ensembldb", "edgeR", "esATAC", "sechm", "motifmatchr","rGREAT",
                       "bsseq","DMRcate","data.table","InteractionSet","chromVAR","limma",
                       "universalmotif", "MotifDb", "TFBSTools", "Biostrings", "PWMEnrich",
                       "Rsubread","Rfastp"))
BiocManager::install("Bioconductor/BiocFileCache")
BiocManager::install("ETHZ-INS/epiwraps")
```
```{r}
install.packages('epiwraps')
library(epiwraps)
```
